        Way out west,Siwa is the tranquil tonic to the hustle of Egypt's cities,
            This gorgeous little oasis, surrounded by date palm plantations
        and numerous fresh water springs, is one of the Western Desert's most picturesque spots.
            The town is centered around the ruins of a vast mud-brick citadel that dominates the view.
            This is a top spot to wind down and go slow for a few days as well as being an excellent base from which to plan adventures into the surrounding desert
